# You know how it goes, week 1 stuff is gonna be easy, not sure if this is how I'll continue to format this repo, but we'll see.

# Looks like when we're turning in stuff for this course, we're going to be turning in .zips of the site folders. I'll store all of the site folders in this repo, so it should be easy to go and grab them when needed.
