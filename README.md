# This repo is going to have all the assignments and folders throughout this course. I might divide everything up into weeks also, but that depends on if we're doing multiple sites per week. It doesn't look like there will be that much, but we'll see.

# Looks like when we're turning in stuff for this course, we're going to be turning in .zips of the site folders. I'll store all of the site folders in this repo, so it should be easy to go and grab them when needed.
