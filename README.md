# This repo is going to have all the assignments and folders throughout this course. I might divide everything up into weeks also, but that depends on if we're doing multiple sites per week. It doesn't look like there will be that much, but we'll see.

# Once each site is complete, I'll also store the .zip folder that I'm using to submit on Canvas in the collective "zip" folder.
